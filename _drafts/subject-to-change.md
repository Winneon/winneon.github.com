*This is my second review of Grisaia no Kajitsu. I am rewriting my first review because my I did not know much of the series at the time, and my wording and writing skills were slightly immature. If you would like, you can view my first review [here][here].*

*Note: The following review includes spoilers for Grisaia no Kajitsu's visual novel and its corresponding anime adaptation. If you plan to either read its visual novel or watch its anime adaptation, please refrain from reading this review. I am not in the habit of ruining a worthwhile story for others.*

If you don't know me, then you ought to know that I absolutely love The Fruit of Grisaia -- more commonly known as Grisaia no Kajitsu. No, it is not a masterpiece and there are a few shy spots here and there, but the story along with its soundtrack and complex characters make up a very complete package that never fails to amaze me. You also ought to know that I am speaking of the visual novel here, and not the recent anime adaptation. I wanted to love the anime adaptation, and at first it had promise. However, it quickly devolved into an advertisement for its source material and fanservice that plagued even the most important of scenes.

Now you might be asking, "Where did it go wrong?" This is not a question that is easily answered. One might say that the main issue stems from the anime's overall length, or another may suggest that it's the studio's fault for the anime's issues. While either of these are valid claims, there is no one reason for the anime's failure. Even then, the anime's failure is subject to opinion. After all, nothing is perfect. But to me, it seemed like Grisaia no Kajitsu's anime adaptation fails at even *basic storytelling*, and that is the main point I will try to bring to light in this review.

I'll get the most obvious issues out of the way first. What [8bit][8bit] tried to do with Grisaia no Kajitsu's anime adaptation was create a single "grand" route that would pave the way for its 2 sequels, Grisaia no Meikyuu (The Labyrinth of Grisaia) and Grisaia no Rakuen (The Eden of Grisaia). If you are new to the visual novel medium, then these next few paragraphs may sound confusing to you at first, but rest assured -- I will try to explain for you.

Visual novels utilize a mechanism that is very similar to the "Choose Your Own Adventure" mechanism some games use, whereas the story or plot progresses, you are presented with a choice. Depending on what choice you make, the story alters itself in accordance to what you chose. The same can be said for visual novels. Depending on your choice, the story may go down a different path than the path it would have gone down if you had chose the other choice. This mechanism I just described is commonly called the "route" mechanism, where multiple "routes" make up visual novels as a whole.

The first visual novel in the Grisaia trilogy, Kajitsu, consists of 5 of these routes, and each of these routes have completely different storylines from one another. Now this sounds like a great way to tell multiple outcomes of the same story in a game (which what fundamentally, a visual novel is), but this is not a correct way to tell a linear story, such as viewed in anime. On top of that, Kajitsu's 2 sequels, Meikyuu and Rakuen, *both* have linear storylines. They both do not utilize this route mechanism I explained earlier. This type of visual novel is generally called a "kinetic novel" (don't ask me why; I didn't make up these names).

Once you consider Kajitsu's route-designed storyline and both Meikyuu's and Rakuen's linear storyline, how does one connect the two sequels to their predecessor? Both Meikyuu and Rakuen assume that Kajitsu's storyline is linear, that's how. They both assume that all of the routes in Kajitsu are a compressed into a single, linear storyline, which is already confusing in its own right. Once you are able to comprehend that change of direction between the 3 visual novels in your head, the storylines of Meikyuu and Rakuen make sense. Here's the problem: this "grand" or linear route that 8bit tried to create in Kajitsu's anime adaptation does not physically make sense from a linear standpoint. To accomplish this, one must rewrite whole sections of the story to fill in the plot holes that are introduced and to bridge the gaps inbetween each route. You might think that 8bit would know this, right? I'm afraid to say you are sadly mistaken.

What 8bit did was what I described earlier -- adapt each route and compress them all into a single linear route. But that is not a worst case scenario. Sure, a linear route adapted from multiple routes is asking for failure, but even that can be slightly remedied by bridging the gaps inbetween the routes. However, 8bit did not do this. In fact, they did nothing at all. Once they completed a route, they moved onto the next, expecting us, the viewer, to bridge the gaps inbetween. This is not a correct way to present a story. Don't get me wrong, there are plenty of examples that have went about this way of adapting its visual novel source material correctly. Some notable examples include White Album 2 (technically a kinetic novel however), Steins;Gate, Clannad & Clannad: After Story, and even the recent TV version of Fate/stay night: Unlimited Blade Works. The difference between these examples and Kajitsu's adaptation is the amount of routes they decided to adapt. In every single one of those examples, the animation studio in charge of its adaptation chose a single route and stuck with it. The studio didn't try to adapt all of the routes in a lazy "omnibus" format (Steins;Gate is a slight exception).

Music was another major issue this anime had, more specifically with its editing and transitions. The term I would use to express my opinion over the use of music in Kajitsu's adaptation would be "lazy". At first, I was pleasantly surprised to see that 8bit decided to use Kajitsu's original score and soundtrack for the adaptation. I felt that this choice would have strengthened the emotional attachment some scenes held, including the "Happy Birthday" sequence at the end of Sachi's route, or the ridiculous "turkey and plane" sequence from the first act of Yumiko's route. Both of these scenes held different emotional responses, but these responses were amplified exponentially by the clever use of music during these scenes. In the adaptation, music was thrown around like a ragdoll. Tracks were cut in half and distorted in some areas, removing the buildup and climax of each track that made the scene in question shine.

Some tense tracks that were intended to be used in special moments or times of great peril were also used like it was nothing. Notable examples of these tracks include 「カサブタ」 and 「デッドロック」. You can listen to these 2 tracks [here][kasabuta] and [here][deadlock]. Even now, listening to these 2 tracks brings an extreme emotional response to me. My gut tightens and I feel sick if I listen for too long (no, I am not kidding). When these 2 tracks were used in the adaptation, for the most part nothing of extreme significance was happening. These 2 tracks served only to create cheap tension, and that was what made me the most disappointed.

Even if you keep what I've said in mind, there are other things that set up the anime for failure. One would be its length. To make a long story short, 8bit compressed 50+ hours of material into 13, 24 minute episodes. If you do the math, that'sa around 5 hours and 12 minutes. Now, each episode is not exactly 24 minutes, so that number is an estimate, but you still get the idea. Compressing 50+ hours of content into ~5 hours requires cutting out a *massive* chunk of the original story, and in doing so, ruins character development or buildup to key plot points. This was the adaptation's failing point for me.

The anime adaptation of Grisaia no Kajitsu expected you to create an emotional attachment with its characters without proper development or time for you to create said attachment. It expected you to feel depressed when a character was depressed, and it expected you to feel joy when a character was full of joy. It might as well have plastered a sign at the top of your screen saying "CRY HERE" when prompted to. Another issue that the adaptation was full of was its pacing. This also ties back into the point I made over compressing 50+ hours of content into a ~5 hour timeline. The section of the story that all 5 routes share, the beginning of a visual novel to the branching point of the 5 routes, is generally called a "common" route. The common route in Kajitsu's visual novel is one of the longest in visual novels -- a whooping 15+ hours. The rest of the 35 hours are split among the 5 routes.

The common route served to create this attachment between you and the story's characters that the anime adaptation so lacked. To do this, it set aside plot development for 15 hours, and instead focused on the character development. The common route of Grisaia no Kajitsu is often critized for its length, but it can be safe to say that without its abnormal length, you would not have felt much of an emotional response when a character's route came up to play. The anime adaptation allocated 3 episodes, *3 episodes*, for the common route. That's just over an hour. I understand that a story can easily develop characters in less than half that time, but for the amount of content Grisaia no Kajitsu comprises, just over an hour is simply not enough time to set up its story.

*(For a more in-depth look into the Japanese animation industry, I highly recommend [SHIROBAKO][sb]. It does a phenomenal job at providing an inside look of the industry, and it answers many questions one may have about the industry. It also has a highly worthwhile story to top it all off.)*
