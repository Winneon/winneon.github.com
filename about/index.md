I am a freelance web developer, web designer, and UI / UX designer. My experience consists of 3+ years in web development and 2+ years in web design. I tweak and perfect UX design in my free time. I was born and am currently based in Texas, United States. My full knowledge of programming consists of the following languages:

* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* Java
* Python
* ... and C / C++ (to a certain degree)

I first gained interest in programming back in 2012 when I had a desire to create plugins for [Bukkit][bk], a [Minecraft][mc] server wrapper. To accomplish this, I taught myself Java as I created a simple Bukkit plugin to familiarize myself with the language, and to also understand how generic computing logic worked (conditionals, loops, etc). As of this time, I have released a single simple Bukkit plugin on BukkitDev called [JoinMessages][jm]. After that, I moved on to web development, and created the [first iteration][v1] of my website. I am currently on the 4th iteration of my website, which you are viewing right now.

Around the time I started working with Java, I joined the [Worlds Collide Network][wcn] (called *Worlds Apart* at the time). Worlds Apart was a small Minecraft community with (at the time) rapid growth. After about 1-2 years, I gained a position in the community and created friendships I still hold today. I have developed many projects in collaboration with them, such as their main website and a [video streaming platform][shows.js].

The name Worlds Apart was scrapped for the name Worlds Collide Network (or *WCN*) when the main Minecraft server merged with another server called Imagicraft. The partnership between the two servers has since been dissolved, but the community still holds the name WCN. I still am a part of the WCN community, even when the community that used to thrive back in 2012 & 2013 is overall dead.

I have other hobbies and interests that I take part in from time to time. Web development is my largest drain of time, but I also enjoy [anime][mal], [visual novels][vndb], and [gaming][steam]. Graduating high school is my main focus as of this time (it really isn't).
