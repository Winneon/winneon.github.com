		<p><em>This is my second review of Grisaia no Kajitsu. I am rewriting my first review because my I did not know much of the series at the time, and my wording and writing skills were slightly immature. If you would like, you can view my first review <a href="http://myanimelist.net/reviews.php?id=174859">here</a>.</em></p>

<p><em>I have not seen 8bit’s anime adaptations of Grisaia no Meikyuu and Grisaia no Rakuen because I am waiting to read their respective visual novels first. Therefore, I will not be covering either of those adaptations in this review.</em></p>

<p><em>Note: The following review includes spoilers for Grisaia no Kajitsu’s visual novel and its corresponding anime adaptation. If you plan to either read its visual novel or watch its anime adaptation, please refrain from reading this review. I am not in the habit of ruining a worthwhile story for others.</em></p>

<h3 id="section">—</h3>

<!-- start -->

<p>If you don’t know me, then you ought to know that I absolutely love The Fruit of Grisaia – more commonly known as Grisaia no Kajitsu. No, it is not a masterpiece and there are a few shy spots here and there, but the story along with its soundtrack and complex characters make up a very complete package that never fails to amaze me. You also ought to know that I am speaking of the visual novel here, and not the recent anime adaptation. I wanted to love the anime adaptation, and at first it had promise. However, it quickly devolved into advertisements for its source material and overbearing fanservice that plagued even the most important of scenes.</p>

<!-- end -->

<p>Now you might be asking, “Where did it go wrong?” This is not a question that is easily answered. One might say that the main issue stems from the anime’s faithfulness to its source material, or another may suggest that it’s the studio’s fault for the anime’s issues. While either of these are valid claims, there is no one reason for the anime’s failure. Even then, the anime’s failure is subject to opinion. After all, nothing is perfect. But to me, it seemed like Grisaia no Kajitsu’s anime adaptation fails at even <em>basic storytelling</em>, and that is the main point I will try to bring to light in this review.</p>

<p>I’ll get the most obvious issues out of the way first. What <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/8-Bit_(studio)">8bit</a> (the animation studio responsible for the Grisaia adaptations) tried to do with Grisaia no Kajitsu’s anime adaptation was create a single “grand” route that would pave the way for Kajitsu’s 2 sequels, Grisaia no Meikyuu (The Labyrinth of Grisaia) and Grisaia no Rakuen (The Eden of Grisaia). If you are new to the visual novel medium, then these next few paragraphs may sound confusing to you at first, but rest assured – I will try to explain for you.</p>

<h3 id="section-1">—</h3>

<p>Visual novels utilize a mechanism that is very similar to the “Choose Your Own Adventure” mechanism some games use, where as the story or plot progresses, you are presented with a choice. Depending on what choice you make, the story alters itself in accordance to what you chose. The same can be said for visual novels. Depending on your choice, the story may go down a different path than the path it would have gone down if you had chose the other choice. This mechanism I just described is commonly called the “route” mechanism, where multiple “routes” make up visual novels as a whole.</p>

<p>The first visual novel in the Grisaia trilogy, Kajitsu, consists of 5 of these routes, and each of these routes have completely different storylines from one another. This sounds like a great way to tell multiple outcomes of the same story in a game (which what fundamentally, a visual novel is), but it is not a correct way to tell a linear story, such as viewed in anime. On top of that, Kajitsu’s 2 sequels, Meikyuu and Rakuen, <em>both</em> have linear storylines. They both do not utilize this route mechanism I explained earlier.</p>

<p>Once you consider Kajitsu’s route-designed storyline and both Meikyuu’s and Rakuen’s linear storyline, how does one connect the two sequels to their predecessor? Both Meikyuu and Rakuen assume that Kajitsu’s storyline is linear, that’s how. They both assume that all of the routes in Kajitsu are compressed into a single, linear storyline, which is already confusing in its own right. Once you are able to comprehend that change of direction between the 3 visual novels in your head, the storylines of Meikyuu and Rakuen make sense. Here’s the problem: this “grand” or linear route that 8bit tried to create in Kajitsu’s anime adaptation does not physically make sense from a linear standpoint. To accomplish this, one must rewrite whole sections of the story to fill in the plot holes that are introduced and to bridge the gaps inbetween each route. You might think that 8bit would know this, right? I’m afraid to say you are sadly mistaken.</p>

<h3 id="section-2">—</h3>

<p>What 8bit did was what I described earlier – adapt each route and compress them all into a single linear route. But that is not a worst case scenario. Sure, a linear route adapted from multiple routes is asking for failure, but even that can be slightly remedied by bridging the gaps inbetween the routes. However, 8bit did not do this. In fact, they did nothing at all. Once they completed a route, they moved onto the next, expecting us, the viewer, to bridge the gaps inbetween. This is not a correct way to present a story. Don’t get me wrong, there are plenty of examples that have went about this way of adapting its visual novel source material correctly. Some notable examples include White Album 2 (technically a kinetic novel however), Steins;Gate, Clannad &amp; Clannad: After Story, and even the recent TV version of Fate/stay night: Unlimited Blade Works. The difference between these examples and Kajitsu’s adaptation is the amount of routes they decided to adapt. In every single one of those examples, the animation studio in charge of its adaptation chose a single route and stuck with it. The studio didn’t try to adapt all of the routes in an “omnibus” format (Steins;Gate is a slight exception).</p>

<p>Music was another major issue this anime had, more specifically with its editing and transitions. The term I would use to express my opinion over the use of music in Kajitsu’s adaptation would be “lazy”. At first, I was pleasantly surprised to see that 8bit decided to use Kajitsu’s original score and soundtrack for the adaptation. I felt that this choice would have strengthened the emotional attachment some scenes held, including the “Happy Birthday” sequence at the end of Sachi’s route, or the ridiculous “turkey and plane” sequence from the first act of Yumiko’s route. Both of these scenes held different emotional responses, but these responses were amplified exponentially by the clever use of music during these scenes. In the adaptation, music was thrown around like a ragdoll. Tracks were cut in half and distorted in some areas, removing the buildup and climax of each track that made the scene in question shine.</p>

<p>Some tense tracks that were intended to be used in special moments or times of great peril were also used like it was nothing. Notable examples of these tracks include 「カサブタ」 and 「デッドロック」. You can listen to these 2 tracks <a href="https://d.maxfile.ro/joaunxqgvp.mp3">here</a> and <a href="https://d.maxfile.ro/vgepjdhsjw.mp3">here</a>. Even now, listening to these 2 tracks brings an extreme emotional response to me. My gut tightens and I feel sick if I listen for too long (no, I am not kidding). When these 2 tracks were used in the adaptation, for the most part nothing of extreme significance was happening. These 2 tracks served only to create cheap tension, and that was what made me the most disappointed.</p>

<h3 id="the-visual-novels-art-top-compared-to-the-anime-adaptations-art-bottom">The visual novel’s art (top) compared to the anime adaptation’s art (bottom).</h3>

<p>The previously said issues are to me, still minor issues compared to the most obvious issue the anime holds – its length. 8bit compressed 50+ hours of material into 13, 24 minute episodes. If you do the math, that’s around 5 hours and 12 minutes. Each episode is not exactly 24 minutes, so that number is an estimate, but you still get the idea. Compressing 50+ hours of content into ~5 hours requires cutting out a <em>massive</em> chunk of the original story, and in doing so, ruins character development or buildup to key plot points. This was the adaptation’s failing point for me.</p>

<p>The anime adaptation of Grisaia no Kajitsu expected you to create an emotional attachment with its characters without proper development or time for you to create said attachment. It expected you to feel depressed when a character was depressed, and it expected you to feel joy when a character was feeling joy. It might as well have plastered a sign at the top of your screen saying “CRY HERE” when prompted to. Another issue that the adaptation was full of was its pacing. This also ties back into the point I made over compressing 50+ hours of content into a ~5 hour timeline. The section of the story that all 5 routes share, the beginning of a visual novel to the branching point of the 5 routes, is generally called a “common” route. The common route in Kajitsu’s visual novel is one of the longest in visual novels – a whooping 15+ hours. The rest of the 35 hours are split among the 5 routes.</p>

<p>The common route served to create this attachment between you and the story’s characters that the anime adaptation so lacked. To do this, it set aside plot development for 15 hours, and instead focused on character development. The common route of Grisaia no Kajitsu is often critized for its length, but it can be safe to say that without its abnormal length, you would not have felt much of an emotional response when a character’s route came up to play. The anime adaptation allocated 3 episodes, <em>3 episodes</em>, for the common route. That’s just over an hour. I understand that a story can easily develop characters in less than half that time, but for the amount of content Grisaia no Kajitsu comprises, just over an hour is simply not enough time to set up its story.</p>

<h3 id="section-4">—</h3>

<p>A commonly thrown around term in the anime fandom is “fanservice”. Fanservice can mean a variety of things. 2 of these meanings include audience pandering and ecchi. The former is used to pander say, a certain scene, towards an audience. The latter however is the most common. Ecchi refers to anything, whether it be a scene or a character, that is meant to create sexual arousal in the viewer. Ecchi is most commonly found in the harem genre, which the Grisaia no Kajitsu series just so happens to fall under. A harem refers to one male character surrounded by a group of female characters, while the opposite, one female character surrounded by a group of male characters, is called a reverse harem.</p>

<p>Grisaia no Kajitsu is not what I would consider “ecchi”. Yes, the original visual novel is an adult game with 10+ sex scenes scattered throughout the storyline, and I can admit that the story would not be affected if these scenes were removed (which they are in the Steam release), but “ecchi” generally is paired with an abuncance of sexually arousing content in a short period of time. Kajitsu’s amount of “ecchi” is too miniscule for me to even consider the visual novel under the genre. But, again, the anime adaptation changed that completely.</p>

<p>While doing a rewatch of the adaptation, I decided to count how many panty shots were shown in the first 2 episodes alone, totalling around 48 minutes of screentime. After double checking by rewatching the same first 2 episodes, I concluded that there are a total of 8 panty shots throughout the course of those episodes. That number is astounding to me, since the amount of panty shots that I can remember from the visual novel doesn’t even hit 5 in the whole 50+ hours of text and dialogue (excluding the adult scenes that is). This not only changes the atmosphere of the adaptation, but it also ruins the already scarse emotional scenes that are present in the adaptation. The most prominent example is Kazuki’s death at the end of Amane’s route. In the visual novel, it is very clear that what is happening is extremely serious and mentally disturbing, but in the adaptation, while the serious atmosphere is present, they pop a panty shot of Kazuki right in the middle of the screen.</p>

<h3 id="section-5">—</h3>

<p>Setting aside the adaptation’s overall length and use of fanservice, there’s still one last aspect, that if done right, could have made the adaptation much more enjoyable. This aspect I am speaking of is the character’s stories themselves. I’ve rambled about incoherent storyline, pacing, music, and the most disappointing of them all, the length. However, without the character stories, the original story would have just been an above-average comedy / slice of life that would not have gained much traction in the visual novel medium. The individual character stories paired with their respective routes are what made the visual novel what it is today.</p>

<p>For the most part, each character story / route is as you would expect from 50+ hours compressed into a ~5 hour storyline: a rushed and horribly paced clusterfuck that skips development of the plot and its characters so that it can reach the next key plot point within the time allotted. That being said, there are some areas that are adapted correctly and actually manage to bring forth some kind of emotional response. The most prominent example of this includes Angelic Howl, the flashback that took up half of the Amane route script. Angelic Howl was actually adapted fairly well, and for a route that is considered to be the most tragic and depressing route in the entirety of the visual novel, the adaptation does it justice. Music is used correctly here and that feeling of something actually at stake is finally present. However, there were also routes that were butchered entirely to the point of no return. The biggest offenders of this is Yumiko’s and Sachi’s respective routes. Sachi’s route suffered the fate of compression of content, but Yumiko’s route – oh man, what they did to Yumiko’s route was beyond redemption.</p>

<p>Before the adaptation, Yumiko’s route was already generally considered to be the weakest route in the visual novel. To me, this is the case only because other 4 routes are just <em>that good</em>. It is like comparing Fate/stay night’s Fate route to the Unlimited Blade Works &amp; Heaven’s Feel routes. The Fate route is amazing if I must say so myself, but most people view it in a distasteful way simply because the UBW and HF routes are so much better than it. But enough of comparisons. To put it in a single sentence, 8bit scrapped the original Yumiko route with an original route that they wrote themselves. Again, there are examples of original content swapped with the source material’s content, and it coming out either as good or better than the source material’s content. But, I’m sorry to say that this is not the case for Yumiko’s route. I understand <em>why</em> they rewrote it. 8bit wanted a “grand” route, and the devleopment in Yumiko’s route prevented this from happening for the most part. But that doesn’t excuse the poor writing in the original route 8bit wrote. To understand truly understand what they did, watch episode 6 of the Grisaia no Kajitsu’s anime adaptation. If you think the story presented in that episode is not half-bad, then I emplore to read Yumiko’s route in the visual novel. I guarantee you will understand what I am talking about.</p>

<h3 id="section-6">—</h3>

<p>I’ve gotten the majority of the negatives out of the way, so let’s focus on the positives. The biggest positive I can give the adaptation is its art. No, the art is not even close to the level of the visual novel’s art, but it does do the original art justice. The animation is also fairly fluid throughout the whole of the adaptation, so that’s another thing I can give it praise for. Other than the animation and art, I had trouble thinking of other aspects that the anime adapted correctly. The common route was done fairly well for the extremely short amount of time it was given, and the OP / ED are both amazing listens. The OP can be viewed <a href="https://d.maxfile.ro/dwtcohjkgy.webm">here</a> and the ED can be viewed <a href="https://d.maxfile.ro/gcsfnxaxnz.webm">here</a>.</p>

<p>Overall, even after going through 17 paragraphs explaining the obvious issues with the anime adaptation, I could say in the end, it wasn’t the worst anime I’ve ever seen (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qcn4ndi4Gcw"><em>*cough*</em> <em>*cough*</em></a>). If you excluded the visual novel from the picture, Grisaia no Kajitsu’s adaptation comes off as slightly above-average, considering all of the ridiculously repetitive battle harems that get released every anime season. But with the visual novel standing on the front lines, the anime adaptation is simply not worth anyone’s time. The visual novel provides the same story, but without all of the issues I outlined in this review. In the end, if there is one thing I want you to get out of this review, it is the screenshot from the anime adaptation below.</p>
